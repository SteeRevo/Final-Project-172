Its' 9:53 AM. You're seated at your usual spot at the coffee shop.

You and Silvia agreed to meet here at 9:00. You haven't seen her all morning.

You've called multiple times, and no one answers.

Your mind goes immediately to the worst places.

"What have I gotten that poor girl involved with?"

But she could be anywhere.

Maybe she just forgot.
