I feel strangely calm in spite of the body in front of me. 

I haven't checked yet, but I'm certain that this person is dead.

It's hard to make out the features in the dark.

But there's a sense of familiarity.

As I go to kneel down next to the body, I hear something behind me.

Rustling in the bushes.

Something is after me.

I run.

I can't get caught, I can't get found with this body.

Every fiber in my body screaming this as my legs move through this forest.
